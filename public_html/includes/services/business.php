        <div class="offset-md-2 col-md-8 offset-md-2">
            <p>Products that leave behind strong odors and toxic residue have long contributed to health issues and are quickly becoming unpopular.  Studies 
            are proving that cleaning alone may actually increase the risk of spreading pathogens throughout an environment. </p>
            <p>It’s time to rethink how we maintain healthy spaces. </p>
            <p>In addition to killing bacteria and viruses, our EPA validated disinfection process eliminates odor-causing biological oils, such as sweat, urine, 
            food, mold etc. </p>

            <h2 class="text-center mb-4 gray-text">Cleaning Does NOT Equal Disinfecting</h2>
            <p>“Clean” does not always equal healthy. In fact, your janitorial service can only help with 1/4 of the problem (appearance). They
            do not have the right equipment, know how, or chemicals to get rid of germs. Even worse, studies show that wiping a surface with a 
            cleaning product can spread disease from one surface to another. The only way to know if you are truly removing germs is to measure 
            and validate. We can show you how during our consultation visit. </p>
            <p>Pathogend disinfects your space, which truly kills the germs.</p>

            <h2 class="text-center mb-4 gray-text">Contamination Spreads Quickly</h2>
            <p>For example, tests have shown that a (benign) virus placed on the front door of a building can contaminate 50%-63% of an office 
            in a span of four to seven hours, simply through touch transfer.  Add humidity and the chances of cross-contamination increase.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Electronic devices harbor bacteria and germs that janitorial services can’t handle </li>
                <li>Doorknobs, hand rails, light switches, elevator buttons, and even walls spread germs </li>
                <li>The #1 productivity man hour killer is germs </li> 
            </ul>
            <p>Pathogend takes care of all these issues and more. </p>

            <h2 class="text-center mb-4 gray-text">Infections Cost $$$</h2>
            <p>When employees (bosses, too) take sick days, companies lose money, time, and productivity. You may even lose customers if you can’t 
            get your orders completed on time or meet with them face-to-face as scheduled.</p>
            <p>Businesses and their employees must stay healthy to compete, especially in today’s markets.</p>
