            <p class="text-center">“I would like to express my gratitude for the excellent service Pathogend of NJ has
                provided the Wayne Memorial First Aid Squad each month. Pathogend approached us in December, 2017
                offering to decontaminate our five ambulances on a monthly basis. They gave a demonstration of the
                service provided and we were very impressed. Pathogend was very interested in helping local businesses
                in Wayne and we were glad they offered. In January, 2018, we experienced a hazmat event which required
                several of our vehicles to be decontaminated. Pathogend responded immediately when we called and
                completely cleaned the involved units. Later during the month, they decontaminated the remainder of our
                fleet. We have been very satisfied with the monthly service provided by Pathogend and would recommend
                their services to others.” </p>
