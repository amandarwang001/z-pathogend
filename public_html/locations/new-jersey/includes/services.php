                Industrial, commercial and residential markets. Our whole-space decontamination approach kills the most
                dangerous hospital super bugs and the bulk of other bacteria and viruses stopping outbreaks in their
                tracks. In essence we give the building its own immune system with a barrier to keep the germs from
                coming back. We also provide routine treatments help keep facilities healthy. A wide variety of

                        Cleaning staff simply don't have the proper training or equipment to eliminate pathogens from
                        all the surfaces people touch (soft surfaces such as cloth seats or curtains, walls, light
                        switches, etc.). Stubborn germs like Flu, MRSA, and Norovirus lurk in waiting rooms, copy rooms,
                        and gym locker rooms, nearly impossible to completely remove using standard cleaning methods.
                        Fortunately, our comprehensive disinfection service uses hospital-grade hydrogen peroxide fog
                        along with other EPA-approved methods proven to kill 99.9999% of germs on every surface without
