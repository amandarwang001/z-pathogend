            <p>Even the best spray and wipe regimen can’t stand up to the rigors of odor-causing bacteria, germ-ridden
                sweat, and nasty fungi. Soft surfaces and nooks and crannies are just too hard for standard cleaning to
                reach and don’t stay saturated long enough to eliminate all harmful pathogens.</p>

            <h3 class="text-center gray-text">The Dirty Secret<br/> About Your "Clean" Facility </h3>
            <p>Your gym and showers look pristine. Your cleaning regimen rivals the most rigorous workout. But, just
                between us, how often do MRSA infections or athletes’ foot occur?</p>
            <p>Traditional bleach cleaning can make the germs seem to go away, but they often “come back” with a
                vengeance. Only whole-space decontamination can eliminate those germs completely.</p>
            <br/>
            <h3 class="text-center gray-text">Outbreaks Can Break Your Business</h3>
            <p>Despite growing awareness, fitness facilities are still plagued by outbreaks.</p>
            <p>Your reputation may not be the only thing you lose if clients contract these germs in your facility.
                All
                over the news, athletes have sued their own teams and gyms for negligence after being infected.</p>
