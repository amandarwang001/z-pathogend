            <p class="pt-3">Todayâ€™s pathogens require new germ warfare technology. Using sporadical disinfectants, microfiber rags,

                <li>Fogging technology greatly reduces the chance of human error by infiltrating places that traditional
                    wiping misses, including areas wiping cannot reach.
