            <p>While desktops and hard flooring receive most cleaning attention, germs populate much harder to clean
                surfaces like carpets in libraries, doorknobs, light switches, walls and cubbies, and undersides/edges
                of tables and chairs (yes, students touch these - just consider how many wads of gum found there).</p>

                reputation depends not

                general facility health. Repeated illnesses will not only affect parent support, but also open you up to
                costly litigation.</p>
